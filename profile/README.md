☘️ **What does the logo mean?**

The Triquetra logo denotes the triad of muscle, fat and bone which make up the main body composition compartments of interest. As cachexia is common at the end of life in cancer and is commonly studied in the context of palliative care, this symbol also reflects the Celtic imagery of the cycle of life, death and rebirth, which is used (in the form of the purple triskele) in Irish hospitals to symbolise that somebody is at the end of life. The idea of rebirth can also refer to the dynamic metabolic state of the human body, which is inherently linked to body composition.
